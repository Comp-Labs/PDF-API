## üëã Introduction

This repo contains the code for a simple [Vercel](https://vercel.com) function that generates a PDF file from any webpage using a [headless Chrome instance](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer).

## üìö Usage

You can use it by placing your function's domain in front of any URL:

```
https://pdf.techfiddle.io/https://github.com/BetaHuhn/vercel-pdf-converter
```

The function will then generate a PDF of that URL and return it as a downloadable file.

Here is how this GitHub Page looks as a PDF:
